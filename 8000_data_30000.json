With 'Trainz Simulator: Settle and Carlisle' you will almost believe that you are there. <br />\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is semaphore signaling with new logic, and water troughs to replenish the tender whilst on the move. AWS (Automatic Warning System) is fitted to some diesel locomotives to give advance indication of the signaling, this provides extra security for the safe running of your consist. <br />\n\t\t\t\t\tFor this steeply graded route large locomotives have been provided, including the powerful Britannia and A3 Pacifics, the LMS 8F 2-8-0 and the BR 9F 2-10-0. The LMS 4F 0-6-0 is included for the lighter trains and for shunting work a choice of the LMS 3F and the L&amp;Y 2F 0-6-0 tank engines. All these locomotives have a multiple choice of running numbers and adjustable headlamp codes. The diesels include the large Class 40 (Whistler) and the versatile Class 37. The smaller Class 24 is included for lighter duties. <br />\n\t\t\t\t\tFor rolling stock there is a new range of Mk1 coaches and an impressive array of new goods vehicles. These include the 4 and 6 wheel tankers, the anhydrite hopper wagons, the Presflo for powder loads. Other goods vehicles will include a variety of vans, open wagons and flat tops to represent the typical goods traffic of the time. The ubiquitous brake van has not been forgotten, of course.", "short_description": "We take you to one of the most famous and scenic British main lines at the time of the transition from steam to diesel power.

Ten game modes - both team-based and &quot;every man for himself&quot; -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Assault Mode</strong> - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Onslaught Mode</strong> - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level!
