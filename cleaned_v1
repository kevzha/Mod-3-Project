In the space of many years they amassed great hordes of diamonds, mined from beneath their very feet. But this wealth was to be their undoing.<br />
<br />
Rumors of their wealth came to the Witch Queen a servant of the banished Horned God. Lying in the poverty of her own filth she lamented to her servants her lack of power and wealth. So she sent Seroneous, an abomination from the pits of Aufstrag, to find and plunder the gnome's holes. &quot;Burn them out of their rooted homes, suffer them not to live but as slaves to our master, Unklar. Make their homes a slagish heap of pain and death. And bring to me their wealth for I'll have war on the lands of dwarf and man.&quot;<br />

So Seroneous, a ghastly, misshapen beast himself, went south and plundered the homes of the gnomes. Those he did not kill he gave to the pits and made them mine the wealth for him. But he has found a land entangled with the intrigues of Human Lords, knight errants, adventurers and other folk. The Red Caps are raiding, Kreelkrug the Ogre demands tribute and there is a magic upon the Well of Waters that defies all comers.<br />

Too, the men of the Barren Wood are fierce, independent and distrustful of outsiders. Facing them is a daunting task in the best of times and now they seem to be protecting one of their own.

Here, in the forest's western eves the trees are old, with tangled roots deep in the ground. Here too the fey still roam wild and free. Ancient ruins, many predating the Winter Dark, lay buried in cool deeps, their halls and towers abandoned to the wilderness and to time. But here too, in these dangerous environs, Unklar's folk have fled, making hidden holes in dark places. So it is with the small and the powerful.<br />

The Old Ziggurat lay empty for many years, but that has, so the tales relates, changed. The Bard Erikendous has come from the lonely paths of those western eves with stories of dark roots in that old place. Of creatures, of Unklar's servants, making their abode there. His tales, crafted into song, are of a Witch Queen. Few of these creatures lived in the days of darkness, but their were dreaded servants, foul and mean women who ate the flesh of their victims.<br />

The ziggurat is a foul place and any would-be heroes willing to enter this abode and challenge the inhabitants must gird themselves for desperate battle against both the arcane and mundane. For here reside one of the Witch Queens of old and she has surrounded herself with the remnants of the Horned One's armies and the cohorts of those wrecked and ruined in the foul pits of Aufstrag.<br />

As in the 2003 animated feature film, the clown fish Nemo is headed for his first day at school when he's captured near Australia's Great Barrier Reef by a scuba diver and winds up in an aquarium in a dentist's office. In the first storyline, players take the role of Nemo's father, Marlin, who with the assistance of a forgetful Regal Blue Tang fish named Dory, must solve puzzles and master arcade-style mini-games in their search for his missing son. The second storyline involves Nemo's attempts to become friends with the other inhabitants of the aquarium in order to join the Tank Gang and help pull off their secret escape plan. Players can switch between the two storylines at anytime during the adventure until the two are united.<br />
<br />
Throughout the adventure, players are introduced to characters from the film who help Marlin and Nemo accomplish tasks. During Marlin's story, players must escape from Bruce the Shark, recover the diver's mask from a sunken submarine, avoid an anglerfish, hop across a maze of jellyfish, and hitch a ride on the current to Sydney Harbor. Meanwhile, mini-games and puzzles in Nemo's segment include using pebbles to jam the aquarium's filter, catching bubbles before they reach the top of the tank, maneuvering through a maze of Tiki heads, helping Jacques get his key chain unstuck, and escaping from a crab-infested sewer pipe.

Villa. This comic was published by Dark Horse Comics in the US and the UK, by Tinta da China in Portugal and by Panini in Germany. <br />
<br />
Resembling a B-class horror movie, the comic book has been praised for its twisted, bizarre and offbeat sense of humor, mixing werewolves, Nazis, the Vatican, zombies and other abominations with lots of hilarious references to timeless films and beloved video games.<br />
<br />
This is the first time ever this title is taken to a video game.<br />
<br />
In this game you’ll :<br />
- Get to team up with a hard boiled Werewolf-Detective, a sixty thousand year old demon trapped in the body of a little girl and a loony Gargoyle's head.<br />
- Interact to your heart’s content with a supernatural underworld filled with deranged puzzles, eerie characters and easter-eggs. <br />
- Get Hours of seat-cracking, world-class comedy (DISCLAIMER: actual length will depend on how witty you are or how long it takes the walkthrough to appear on the internet).<br />
- Explore up to 30 astonishing handmade, chill-inducing, graphic-novel inspired locations.<br />
- Uncomfortably greet an array of classical monsters and find out why each and everyone of them hates you.<br />
- Behold the latest technology on monologues, dialogue globes, thought bubbles and vignette-building, that’ll bring the utter magnificence of graphic novels into your, otherwise, boring screen. <br />
- Be soothed by the melodic ambient sounds of a 60’s jazzy soundtrack and screech at many other uneasy sounds.<br />

Fly away like nothing else matters.<br />

The game play is a mix of strategy, in that you need to figure out an effective plan to beat the encounters, and management, in that you need to balance the various needs and desires of your team of players. <br><br>While the game does revolve around trying to win battles to progress, it's not your typical RPG combat. As the leader, you do not directly control your group. You set-up an initial plan, but your group members may decide to go off and do their own thing! You can shout a command at them each turn to try to keep them in line, and do your best to keep them happy with items and by paying attention to their needs.","['Parody Games, LLC']",,,,,"[{'id': '23', 'description': 'Indie'}, {'id': '3', 'description': 'RPG'}, {'id': '28', 'description': 'Simulation'}, {'id': '2', 'description': 'Strategy'}]",False,,[],[],,It's A Wipe!,"{'minimum': '<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP or newer<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Anything that should run windows should run this<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Any Directx8 OpenGL Compatible card<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 8.0<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Any OpenAL Compatible Card<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The game is designed to be fairly light weight.

Assemble your own ships from a number of components and explore procedurally generated galaxies!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Building your Ship</h2>At the core of the game lies the ship editor. An editor that allows you to freely assemble your very own spaceships using a vast variety of (currently) over 60 modules. The way you build your ships determines how they behave and what they are capable of doing, and, as every module costs money, weight and energy, designing a good, efficient spaceship is a challenging yet rewarding task.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Expedition and Sandbox Mode</h2>The expedition mode lets you explore a procedurally generated galaxy inhabited by the von-Neumann; a constantly evolving AI species. You begin with a small, basic ship and advance as you complete missions, discover new enemy species, and scavenge more powerful or exotic components to improve your ship with. Alternatively, you can always build any ship you like without any constraints in the sandbox mode.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Artificial Intelligence</h2>Being a single player game, a lot of attention is being given to the game's artificial intelligence system. The von-Neumann enemies you will encounter in the expedition mode have been painstakingly created using elaborate artificial evolutions, in which vast numbers of mutating ships have competed for survival. Several bonus game modes allow you to lean back and watch just how different AI species compete with each other for survival and how each generation evolves.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FAQ</h2>Q: Which are the supported platforms?<br>A: The game supports Windows, Linux, SteamOS and MacOS. Mac users do still need to manually install Java though (worry not, it's free).<br><br>Q: Will there be a multiplayer mode?<br>A: Unfortunately implementing multiplayer support is exceedingly complex. Therefore I am focusing on providing a solid single player experience instead.  <br>Q: What types of ships can you build? <br>A: Any ship built with the available modules is valid as long, of course, as the modules do not overlap. You can build ships with moving parts as well as ships consisting of multiple ship parts (which can be controlled individually). <br><br>Q: How large can the ships be?<br>A: You can add modules to your ship as long as they fit within the editor's boundaries and its 14x14 grid (which can be expanded to 18x18 using the integrity enhancer module). <br><br>Q: How many module types are there? <br>A: There are currently over 60 module types in the game (not counting visual variations). More modules will be added in the future.

Assemble your own ships from a number of components and explore procedurally generated galaxies!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Building your Ship</h2>At the core of the game lies the ship editor. An editor that allows you to freely assemble your very own spaceships using a vast variety of (currently) over 60 modules. The way you build your ships determines how they behave and what they are capable of doing, and, as every module costs money, weight and energy, designing a good, efficient spaceship is a challenging yet rewarding task.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Expedition and Sandbox Mode</h2>The expedition mode lets you explore a procedurally generated galaxy inhabited by the von-Neumann; a constantly evolving AI species. You begin with a small, basic ship and advance as you complete missions, discover new enemy species, and scavenge more powerful or exotic components to improve your ship with. Alternatively, you can always build any ship you like without any constraints in the sandbox mode.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Artificial Intelligence</h2>Being a single player game, a lot of attention is being given to the game's artificial intelligence system. The von-Neumann enemies you will encounter in the expedition mode have been painstakingly created using elaborate artificial evolutions, in which vast numbers of mutating ships have competed for survival. Several bonus game modes allow you to lean back and watch just how different AI species compete with each other for survival and how each generation evolves.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FAQ</h2>Q: Which are the supported platforms?<br>A: The game supports Windows, Linux, SteamOS and MacOS.

181,"You’re Going Down! Enter the Deep Dungeons of Doom if you dare…<br />
<br />
This game is only for the brave. Dungeons await, each one deeper, each one more perilous and each one more challenging than the last.<br />
<br />
You will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. You may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary – in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest – but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself.<br />
<br />
The reward for your endeavours? The Deepest Dungeon of Doom. Never before has such evil existed on such a massive scale. Only the most battle-hardened rogues will stand a chance of making an impact.<br />

Game Features:<br />
<br />
• Relive the 8-bit era with super-stylised visuals, music and SFX<br />
• Simple gameplay with a wicked learning curve<br />
• Choose from 3 characters, each with their own unique abilities<br />
• Battle monsters in increasingly deep and difficult dungeons<br />

203,"Welcome to the long-awaited sequel to the popular action/strategy game! New weapons, landscapes, and options galore! Every game session is now even more dynamic and amazing.<br />
<br />
The core of the game is still the same: entire armies of enemies rush at your defenses, trying to destroy them by any means necessary. But now they’re even more powerful and madder than ever.<br />
<br />
You’ll have access to older, time-tested turrets, as well as completely new types of weapons. It’s up to you to decide how to spend your available budget. Should you build new towers or upgrade and fortify the ones you already have? Turrets vary in terms of their attack range, firing speed, and damage type. The only way to win is to combine them so that they complement and strengthen one another.<br />
<br />
The flexible difficulty settings will allow every player to get as much enjoyment out of the game as possible. If you’re an experienced commander, you’ll love the merciless, intense battles where the countdown where even a fraction of a second is vital to success and everything hinges on your ability to choose and arrange your turrets wisely. If you’re a new player, you’ll easily be able to train and prepare yourself for serious battles.<br />
<br />
Either way, the thoughtfully designed maps and wide range of available turrets will provide you with virtually endless tactical options. Thanks to the stunning, detailed landscapes, painstakingly drawn towers, and incredible special effect, you won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen.<br />
<br />
All aspects of the game have been meticulously balanced, including tower statistics, enemy strength, terrain characteristics, and special weapons. You’ll never get bored by too-easy gameplay. Every level will challenge you. Are you ready to accept the challenge?<br />

226,"Verde Station is a first-person story/experience game set on a space station. During your year long solo mission you begin to question the world around you. The game reacts in subtle ways to how you play. Aboard Verde Station, you will test your wits, question everything, and strain to keep your sanity. Welcome to solitude.<br><br>It is highly recommended that if you like games that aim to surprise you and keep you questioning what's happening, do not read much about the game. The less you know the better experience you'll have. You can only play it for the first time once.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay:</h2>Verde Station is a game of small details, many of which can easily be missed. It can be considered a mystery box game, walking simulator, exploration game, or story game. At its core, Verde Station is an interactive exploration game that lightly reacts to how you play it. Examine every detail of the station, pick up and view items, and dig into computer terminals. You will uncover clues about the station and have to decide if you can trust what you see and hear. As the answers come, so do more questions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features:</h2><strong>Reactive Storytelling:</strong> The core story of Verde Station is fixed but depending on how you interact with the game you will have a slightly different experience. The world around you reacts to the type of player you are. These are subtle changes specifically designed to match your personality. They are also specifically designed so you won't notice most of them until a second or third play-through.<br><br><strong>Interactive Exploration:</strong> Examine every item in the station or just a few. Some items even react to how you interact with them. The more you explore, the more story you reveal, and the more you discover about what's really happening.

During your year long solo mission you begin to question the world around you. The game reacts in subtle ways to how you play. Aboard Verde Station, you will test your wits, question everything, and strain to keep your sanity. Welcome to solitude.<br><br>It is highly recommended that if you like games that aim to surprise you and keep you questioning what's happening, do not read much about the game. The less you know the better experience you'll have. You can only play it for the first time once.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay:</h2>Verde Station is a game of small details, many of which can easily be missed. It can be considered a mystery box game, walking simulator, exploration game, or story game. At its core, Verde Station is an interactive exploration game that lightly reacts to how you play it. Examine every detail of the station, pick up and view items, and dig into computer terminals. You will uncover clues about the station and have to decide if you can trust what you see and hear. As the answers come, so do more questions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features:</h2><strong>Reactive Storytelling:</strong> The core story of Verde Station is fixed but depending on how you interact with the game you will have a slightly different experience. The world around you reacts to the type of player you are. These are subtle changes specifically designed to match your personality. They are also specifically designed so you won't notice most of them until a second or third play-through.<br><br><strong>Interactive Exploration:</strong> Examine every item in the station or just a few. Some items even react to how you interact with them. The more you explore, the more story you reveal, and the more you discover about what's really happening.
