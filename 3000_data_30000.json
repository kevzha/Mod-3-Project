Additionally, each faction will have to contend with its unique events and dilemmas.<br><br>New Military Traditions \u2013 Each of the Greek States has a unique top-tier military tradition: Athenian fleets may be honoured as Children of the Aegaean, improving the ramming ability of their ships whilst allowing them to secure more income when raiding; Spartan armies may be remembered as Peers of Leonidas, improving their melee defense capabilities and reducing their upkeep; the armies of Epirus may be feared as Hounds of Molossus, granting them greater charge bonuses whilst allowing them to keep public order problems in check.<br><br>New Units:<br><br>In addition to the intimidating unit rosters of each faction now playable for the first time, the Greek States Culture Pack introduces a variety of unique and especially elite and deadly forces.<br><br>Mercenary Veteran Hoplites \u2013 [available to all playable factions]<br>From glistening spear points to earth-shaking tread, a phalanx is a sight and sound to inspire dread. With these veteran hoplites, that dread is sold to the highest bidder.<br><br>Thureos Hoplites \u2013 [Available to Athens]<br>While the linen breastplates worn by these men may look flimsy, they are cool, practical and surprisingly tough. As with all hoplites, the men inside are also practical and tough warriors.<br><br>Thorax Hoplites \u2013 [Unique to Athens]<br>These heavy hoplites are marked by their bronze breastplate armour, a sign of wealth and status. They are armed with spears and hoplon shields, and use the phalanx formation to batter enemies into submission.<br><br>Agrianian Axemen \u2013 [Unique to Epirus and Macedon]<br>The Paeonian tribe of Agrianes are fierce fighters. As well as terrible killing tools, their axes are also climbing hooks for rough terrain. No sensible general would not use them in an assault.<br><br>Aspis Companion Cavalry \u2013 [Unique to Epirus and Macedon]<br>A king\u2019s companions in battle are his nobles and esteemed friends. It is an honour to be a companion, to ride forth with javelin and kopis to fight for your lord and master.<br><br>Heroes of Sparta \u2013 [Unique to Sparta]<br>Embodying the spirit of Thermopylae, the Heroes Of Sparta bear their spears and shields with fierce pride and unrivalled mastery.<br><br>Polybolos Repeating Scorpion \u2013 [Siege Deployable available to all Greek, Roman and Carthaginian factions]<br>Able to make short work of even the most heavily-armoured opponents, this repeating bolt thrower   sacrifices the ordinary Scorpion\u2019s range in return for a rapid rate of fire.<br><br>Tortoise Armoured Battering Ram \u2013 [Siege Deployable available to all Greek, Roman and Carthaginian factions]<br>Combining devastating ramming power while affording protection to its crew, used well the Tortoise more than makes up for its lack of speed and manoeuvrability in open ground.<br><br>New Buildings:<br><br>The Monument of Leonidas \u2013 [Unique to Sparta]<br>A symbol of Sparta\u2019s overridingly martial culture, The Monument of Leonidas brings cost reductions to military recruitment, significantly increases the morale of land units in the province and a global morale boost to existing units.<br><br>Oracle of Dodona \u2013 [Unique to Epirus]<br>This sacred grove is the domain of the priests and priestesses of Epirus. The Oracle of Dodona increases provincial happiness, wealth, and the global conversion of other factions to Hellenic culture.<br><br>Acropolis \u2013 [Unique to Athens]<br>A symbol of Athenian high culture and engineering excellence, The Acropolis also provides extra garrison forces to Athens, increases tax level, improves the city\u2019s abilities to withstand sieges, and increases Athenian agents\u2019 Authority actions.<br><br>Faction History:<br><br>Athens <br>Athens has long been famed for its cultural achievements, from buildings such as the Parthenon, to the plays and works of Aristophanes, Plato, Socrates, and Sophocles. In many ways, Greek culture is defined by Athens. Its military focus has long been its navy; however, continuing the traditions of the classical era, its citizens are also expected to contribute both infantry and cavalry to its armies.<br><br>Epirus <br>Epirus is a Greek kingdom formed of numerous small villages and towns, rather than the great cities of the south. An agriculture and fishing-based society, Epirus nevertheless maintains a balanced army on the Alexandrian model, consisting of cavalry, archers, peltasts, phalangites and war elephants. They also make extensive use of mercenaries from throughout the Greek-speaking world.<br><br>Sparta <br>With every aspect of their lives and society geared towards warfare, Sparta dominated the Greek world and continues to produce arguably the finest soldiers of the Hellenic period. The slaves and non-citizens of Sparta enable their citizens to pursue warrior perfection as soldiers and champions. Trained and hardened in battle, their warriors and leaders are the embodiment of military discipline and virtue.", "about_the_game": "The Greek States Culture Pack adds a new playable Culture including three new playable Factions to Total War: ROME II; for use in Single or Multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer Battles.<br><br>The Greek States Culture Pack adds diplomatic Athens, shrewd Epirus and formidable Sparta as playable factions.

However, they are defined by their fierce independence and between them demonstrate a huge variety in approach to civil and military challenges that often brings them into conflict with the wider world, and each other.<br><br>New Features:<br><br>New Playable Factions \u2013 Athens, Epirus and Sparta each offer a unique new way to experience the campaign, with their own rosters of powerful military units, distinct traits and play styles.<br>The Athenian pursuit of enlightenment grants them technological and cultural bonuses; Sparta\u2019s dominance over the Helots allows them to maintain a larger slave population; and Epirus enjoys bonuses to settlement exploitation stemming from their village-confederation origins.<br><br>New Cultural Traits \u2013 All Greek States benefit from a bonus in battle when defending their own or an allied territory, a bonus to wealth generated by their capitals and an increase to the rate of cultural conversion within their borders.<br><br>New Cultural Objectives \u2013 Greek States have their own new set of military, economic and cultural victory conditions, as well as sharing a unique set of bonus objectives drawn from Greek history. Additionally, each faction will have to contend with its unique events and dilemmas.<br><br>New Military Traditions \u2013 Each of the Greek States has a unique top-tier military tradition: Athenian fleets may be honoured as Children of the Aegaean, improving the ramming ability of their ships whilst allowing them to secure more income when raiding; Spartan armies may be remembered as Peers of Leonidas, improving their melee defense capabilities and reducing their upkeep; the armies of Epirus may be feared as Hounds of Molossus, granting them greater charge bonuses whilst allowing them to keep public order problems in check.<br><br>New Units:<br><br>In addition to the intimidating unit rosters of each faction now playable for the first time, the Greek States Culture Pack introduces a variety of unique and especially elite and deadly forces.<br><br>Mercenary Veteran Hoplites \u2013 [available to all playable factions]<br>From glistening spear points to earth-shaking tread, a phalanx is a sight and sound to inspire dread. With these veteran hoplites, that dread is sold to the highest bidder.<br><br>Thureos Hoplites \u2013 [Available to Athens]<br>While the linen breastplates worn by these men may look flimsy, they are cool, practical and surprisingly tough. As with all hoplites, the men inside are also practical and tough warriors.<br><br>Thorax Hoplites \u2013 [Unique to Athens]<br>These heavy hoplites are marked by their bronze breastplate armour, a sign of wealth and status. They are armed with spears and hoplon shields, and use the phalanx formation to batter enemies into submission.<br><br>Agrianian Axemen \u2013 [Unique to Epirus and Macedon]<br>The Paeonian tribe of Agrianes are fierce fighters. As well as terrible killing tools, their axes are also climbing hooks for rough terrain. No sensible general would not use them in an assault.<br><br>Aspis Companion Cavalry \u2013 [Unique to Epirus and Macedon]<br>A king\u2019s companions in battle are his nobles and esteemed friends. It is an honour to be a companion, to ride forth with javelin and kopis to fight for your lord and master.<br><br>Heroes of Sparta \u2013 [Unique to Sparta]<br>Embodying the spirit of Thermopylae, the Heroes Of Sparta bear their spears and shields with fierce pride and unrivalled mastery.<br><br>Polybolos Repeating Scorpion \u2013 [Siege Deployable available to all Greek, Roman and Carthaginian factions]<br>Able to make short work of even the most heavily-armoured opponents, this repeating bolt thrower   sacrifices the ordinary Scorpion\u2019s range in return for a rapid rate of fire.<br><br>Tortoise Armoured Battering Ram \u2013 [Siege Deployable available to all Greek, Roman and Carthaginian factions]<br>Combining devastating ramming power while affording protection to its crew, used well the Tortoise more than makes up for its lack of speed and manoeuvrability in open ground.<br><br>New Buildings:<br><br>The Monument of Leonidas \u2013 [Unique to Sparta]<br>A symbol of Sparta\u2019s overridingly martial culture, The Monument of Leonidas brings cost reductions to military recruitment, significantly increases the morale of land units in the province and a global morale boost to existing units.<br><br>Oracle of Dodona \u2013 [Unique to Epirus]<br>This sacred grove is the domain of the priests and priestesses of Epirus. The Oracle of Dodona increases provincial happiness, wealth, and the global conversion of other factions to Hellenic culture.<br><br>Acropolis \u2013 [Unique to Athens]<br>A symbol of Athenian high culture and engineering excellence, The Acropolis also provides extra garrison forces to Athens, increases tax level, improves the city\u2019s abilities to withstand sieges, and increases Athenian agents\u2019 Authority actions.<br><br>Faction History:<br><br>Athens <br>Athens has long been famed for its cultural achievements, from buildings such as the Parthenon, to the plays and works of Aristophanes, Plato, Socrates, and Sophocles. In many ways, Greek culture is defined by Athens. Its military focus has long been its navy; however, continuing the traditions of the classical era, its citizens are also expected to contribute both infantry and cavalry to its armies.<br><br>Epirus <br>Epirus is a Greek kingdom formed of numerous small villages and towns, rather than the great cities of the south. An agriculture and fishing-based society, Epirus nevertheless maintains a balanced army on the Alexandrian model, consisting of cavalry, archers, peltasts, phalangites and war elephants. They also make extensive use of mercenaries from throughout the Greek-speaking world.<br><br>Sparta <br>With every aspect of their lives and society geared towards warfare, Sparta dominated the Greek world and continues to produce arguably the finest soldiers of the Hellenic period. The slaves and non-citizens of Sparta enable their citizens to pursue warrior perfection as soldiers and champions. Trained and hardened in battle, their warriors and leaders are the embodiment of military discipline and virtue.", "short_description": "The Greek States Culture Pack adds a new playable Culture including three new playable Factions to Total War: ROME II; for use in Single or Multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer Battles.The Greek States Culture Pack adds diplomatic Athens, shrewd Epirus and formidable Sparta as playable factions.", "fullgame": {"appid": "214950", "name": "Total War\u2122: ROME II - Emperor Edition"}, "supported_languages": "English<strong>*</strong>, German<strong>*</strong>, French<strong>*</strong>, Italian, Spanish - Spain, Russian, Polish, Czech, Turkish<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support", "header_image": "https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/212301/header.jpg?t=1540813670", "website": "http://www.totalwar.com/rome2", "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2 GHz Intel Dual Core processor / 2.6 GHz Intel Single Core processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1GB RAM (XP), 2GB RAM (Vista / Windows 7 or 8)  GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>512 MB Direct 9.0c compatible card (shader model 3)<br>\t</li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:</strong>9.0c<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>30 GB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>Screen Resolution - Minimum spec: 1024x768 minimum/ Recommended spec: 1280x1024 minimum (ALL SPECS ARE CURRENTLY NOT FINAL AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME)</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2nd Generation Intel Core i5 processor (or greater)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2GB Ram (XP), 4GB RAM (Vista / Windows 7 or 8)  GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>1024 MB DirectX 11 compatible graphics card.<br>\t</li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:</strong>11<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>30 GB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>Screen Resolution - Minimum spec: 1024x768 minimum/ Recommended spec: 1280x1024 minimum (ALL SPECS ARE CURRENTLY NOT FINAL AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME)</li></ul>"}, "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "\u2022 Operating System: OS X 10.7.5 <br />\r\n\u2022 Processor: 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 <br />\r\n\u2022 RAM: 4 GB RAM <br />\r\n\u2022 Hard Drive: 25 GB <br />\r\n\u2022 Video Card: 512 MB AMD Radeon HD 4850, NVidia GeForce 640 or Intel HD 4000 <br />\r\n\u2022 Screen Resolution: 1024x768.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnsupported graphics chipsets for Mac: NVidia GeForce 9 series, GeForce 300 series, GeForce Quadro series, AMD Radeon HD 4000 series, Radeon HD 2000 series", "recommended": "\u2022 Operating System: OS X 10.7.5 (or later) <br />\r\n\u2022 Processor: 2nd Generation<br />\r\nIntel Core i5 (or greater) <br />\r\n\u2022 RAM: 8 GB RAM <br />\r\n\u2022 Hard Drive: 25 GB <br />\r\n\u2022 Video Card: 1 GB NVidia 750 (or better) <br />\r\n\u2022 Screen Resolution: 1920x1080.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnsupported graphics chipsets for Mac: NVidia GeForce 9 series, GeForce 300 series, GeForce Quadro series, AMD Radeon HD 4000 series, Radeon HD 2000 series"}, "linux_requirements": [], "legal_notice": "\u00a9 SEGA.

based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like and the complex undertones of Illwinter's Dominions series. While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.<br><br>The main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals.  Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.<br><br>In each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired &quot;location&quot; it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have<br></li><li> Copious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad<br></li><li> Random maps.<br></li><li> Spell system with 42 magic paths<br></li><li> Network or hotseat multiplayer<br></li><li> Team play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.<br></li><li> Stealth and invisibility.

What Firebug wouldn't want this addition to his arsenal? \n<li><strong>Buzzsaw Bow:</strong> A crossbow modified to shoot spinning saw blades sounds insane, and it is. That's why we gave this weapon to the Berserker. Just watch that little blade of death bounce around!</ul>\n", "short_description": "Straight from the talented community modders of the IJC crew comes the first DLC weapon pack for Killing Floor.
