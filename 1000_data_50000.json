Planting costs gold, which can be gathered by farmers. Most units can only attack or defend against monsters in the lane they are put in. In later levels, players can purchase stronger units with different offensive and defensive abilities.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/929330/extras/gif_1.png?t=1540337037\" ><br><br>The monsters also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Monsters include those wearing armor, those who can jump or fly over units, big bosses. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of monsters.<br><br> If a monster reaches the end of a lane, a knight group will shoot forward and destroy all the monsters in that lane. However, if a monster reaches the end of that same lane for the second time, it will reach Camelot. When this happens, the game will then end and display the Game Over dialog box.     <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/929330/extras/features.png?t=1540337037\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Enjoy 100+ fascinating hours of gameplay.<br></li><li> Battle all 160 levels of Campaign mode through day, night and fog, in a jungle, castle, at the beach or river.<br></li><li> Earn 44 powerful units and collect coins to buy magic flags, power-ups and more.<br></li><li> Take on 33 types of enemy monster including ogres, trolls, undeads, and demons.<br></li><li> Play with many game modes: Campaign Attack, Campaign Defend, and Survival Endless Mode.

In Show Me 66: Main Street Through Missouri, Missouri takes center stage in the story of the nation\u2019s most famous highways. Although Route 66 existed for less than 60 years, it quickly claimed its place as the Main Street of America and gained mystique as a road for unexpected encounters and personal journeys. It was a road for &quot;getting your kicks&quot; and finding your spirit, an international icon with a complex legacy. Route 66 stretched 2,400 miles across eight states, but some of its most overlooked and essential stories can be found in its 300 miles through Missouri. Equal parts travelogue and historical narrative, Show Me 66 explores the sights and landscapes found along Route 66 in Missouri. It also examines the Show-Me State's biggest Route 66 stories from across the decades, including the road's birth in Springfield, the effects of World War II, the road's relationship to the Ozarks and St. Louis, its decline to the interstates, and the rediscovery still taking place today.

The wallpaper is active all the time so that you always have a unique view. Unlike standard &quot;flat&quot; wallpapers, this one will always be something else. A 3D environment posed for interaction, which allows you to influence its appearance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Can I Play Games With This Wallpaper?</strong></h2>Of course! To reduce almost to 0 using the processor and graphics card at any time you can &quot;pause&quot; the wallpaper and return to it when you finish playing. Also recommended when working on larger projects or renderings. Unfortunately, at the present moment, it is not possible to automate this process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Consumption Of Pc Resources</strong></h2></h2>As it is a 3D application it must take its own. We have this in mind and therefore maintaining low demand is our priority. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also appears on mobile devices (Android) and works great on medium range phones. The wallpaper also has graphics settings so you can limit some effects. Just like in games, you can set options for your PC hardware.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Why Earth?</strong></h2></h2>The idea came up years ago when I watched recordings from the ISS International Space Station. The views are amazing but I missed one ... freedom of flight control. The graphics engine allows more, for example, interactive countries. And that's how the project was made ...;)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Do the Project Will Be Developed</strong></h2></h2>Of course, we still have ideas and sometimes users themselves share their ideas with us that we will try to add in the amendments. Unfortunately, we are very limited by the use of PC resources so we can not implement all ideas. For example, we could use texture 64k! (sic!) but the project would take almost 4GB when it's just a &quot;wallpaper&quot; ;d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Support</strong></h2></h2>We are a tiny team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify well-known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, bringing something new to your screen. Every support is valuable to us. Ratings and comments help us move forward and make even better interactive wallpapers.<br><br>3D Earth Time Lapse PC is our first project on the Steam platform, but we promise that with your support there will be more truly unique projects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Have A Nice Flight!</h2></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3DM</h2>", "about_the_game": "<img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/927730/extras/Windows_10_Only.png?t=1553357287\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong></h2>Windows 10 only!

The views are amazing but I missed one ... freedom of flight control. The graphics engine allows more, for example, interactive countries. And that's how the project was made ...;)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Do the Project Will Be Developed</strong></h2></h2>Of course, we still have ideas and sometimes users themselves share their ideas with us that we will try to add in the amendments. Unfortunately, we are very limited by the use of PC resources so we can not implement all ideas. For example, we could use texture 64k! (sic!) but the project would take almost 4GB when it's just a &quot;wallpaper&quot; ;d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Support</strong></h2></h2>We are a tiny team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify well-known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, bringing something new to your screen. Every support is valuable to us. Ratings and comments help us move forward and make even better interactive wallpapers.<br><br>3D Earth Time Lapse PC is our first project on the Steam platform, but we promise that with your support there will be more truly unique projects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Have A Nice Flight!</h2></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3DM</h2>", "short_description": "3D Interactive desktop wallpaper for Windows 10.", "supported_languages": "English, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish - Latin America, Turkish", "reviews": "\u201c[RECOMMENDED] This is a pretty nice live wallpaper to have, a good view from the International Space Station while it orbits around Earth.

Things begin to take a turn when his brother Rajveer 20, loses his patience with the locals who constantly label him as a terrorist due to his turban and beard. Despite the strong objection of their father SARJIT 50, Rajveer decides to leave home to join the Australian army. Excited at first with Rajveer's decision, Ajit soon realises the peril of war through his classmate and the news on TV. Ajit begs his father to go after Rajveer and bring him home. Sarjit relents and they race to Perth in pursuit of Rajveer. However, Sarjit crashes the car and loses his life. Ajit is then rescued by a mob of Aboriginal travelers. Together they help Ajit to cremate his father in middle of the outback. Ajit now has a new objective of making sure that Rajveer is able to perform a last prayer &quot;Antim Ardas&quot; for Sarjit within eleven days. Seeing that Ajit is alone and lost, the mob choses a reluctant TJIIDRM 12, to accompany Ajit to the city. An extremely suspicious and angry young Tjiidrm grudgingly guides Ajit in order to take Sarjit's to Rajveer. Their rivalry eventual turns to friendship when Tjiidrm begins to see that Ajit is not a threat like the 'white fellas'. This friendship is eventually sealed when Ajit reveals how his mother was gunned down in a terrorist attack back in India. This is especially poignant as we realise that Tjiidrm is also an orphan like Ajit. When they finally reach the edge of the city, Tjiidrm reveals that Ajit now has to strike out on his own. Ajit finally marches through the city in search of Rajveer but his plans are thwarted when he is lured in to a dark alley and robbed. Two young ladies, CINDY and BEV manage to scare the thief away but before Ajit could recover the note with his brother's address. Ajit runs away from them too thanks Tjiidrm who has drilled in to Ajit to not trust the white fellas or he would be place in a orphanaged and turned in to a Christan. Alone, lost and confused Ajit passes out in the street. He wakes up to find himself in Cindy's apartment who convinces him to let her help him find his brother but by the time they get there Rajveer's had already been shipped to basic training in a camp about 1200 kilometers away. Cindy then convinces Bev to persuade her boyfriend, JACK 30's who is an outback pilot to fly Ajit to the Army camp. Cindy transfers Sarjit's ashes into a metal urn as gift to Ajit. On the flight to the camp, the small plane runs into trouble and is force to land about 120 KMs from the Laverton where the camp is situated. Desperate and furious, Ajit sneaks out in the middle of the night to make up for the time that he is losing. In this chapter Ajit goes through a phase of hallucination and self discovery. He also hunts like Tjiidrm, abandoning his vegetarian practice. Ajit finally reaches the edge of the camp but is spotted by a sniper in training, in the ensuing panic and miscommunication Ajit is fired upon. The screen goes blank before we see Rajveer cradling him and screams to reveal that it is his brother. Fortunately, the metal urn took the hit and Ajit comes to. The film ends with an areal shot of Ajit and Rajveer immersing Sarjit's ashes by the ocean.", "about_the_game": "Ajit Singh 12, finds himself planted in the middle of an Australian outback town when his father decided to uproot his family.

This is especially poignant as we realise that Tjiidrm is also an orphan like Ajit. When they finally reach the edge of the city, Tjiidrm reveals that Ajit now has to strike out on his own. Ajit finally marches through the city in search of Rajveer but his plans are thwarted when he is lured in to a dark alley and robbed. Two young ladies, CINDY and BEV manage to scare the thief away but before Ajit could recover the note with his brother's address. Ajit runs away from them too thanks Tjiidrm who has drilled in to Ajit to not trust the white fellas or he would be place in a orphanaged and turned in to a Christan. Alone, lost and confused Ajit passes out in the street. He wakes up to find himself in Cindy's apartment who convinces him to let her help him find his brother but by the time they get there Rajveer's had already been shipped to basic training in a camp about 1200 kilometers away. Cindy then convinces Bev to persuade her boyfriend, JACK 30's who is an outback pilot to fly Ajit to the Army camp. Cindy transfers Sarjit's ashes into a metal urn as gift to Ajit. On the flight to the camp, the small plane runs into trouble and is force to land about 120 KMs from the Laverton where the camp is situated. Desperate and furious, Ajit sneaks out in the middle of the night to make up for the time that he is losing. In this chapter Ajit goes through a phase of hallucination and self discovery. He also hunts like Tjiidrm, abandoning his vegetarian practice. Ajit finally reaches the edge of the camp but is spotted by a sniper in training, in the ensuing panic and miscommunication Ajit is fired upon. The screen goes blank before we see Rajveer cradling him and screams to reveal that it is his brother. Fortunately, the metal urn took the hit and Ajit comes to. The film ends with an areal shot of Ajit and Rajveer immersing Sarjit's ashes by the ocean.", "short_description": "Eleven Days follows Ajit Singh, a 12 year old boy racing against time to locate his brother to stop him from getting trapped in the vicious cycle of terrorism.", "fullgame": {"appid": null, "name": "Uninitialized"}, "supported_languages": "English", "header_image": "https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/984370/header.jpg?t=1545251774", "website": "https://www.elevendaysmovie.com", "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 or AMD equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 5Mbps for 540p, 3Mbps for 360p.</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core I3+ or AMD equivalent recommended for HD 1080p playback<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 12Mbps for 1080p or 8Mbps for 720p.</li></ul>"}, "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OSX 10.7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 or AMD equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 5Mbps for 540p, 3Mbps for 360p.</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OSX 10.10+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core I3+ or AMD equivalent recommended for HD 1080p playback<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 12Mbps for 1080p or 8Mbps for 720p.</li></ul>"}, "linux_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux Ubuntu 12.04 or later, SteamOS 2.20 or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 or AMD equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 5Mbps for 540p, 3Mbps for 360p.</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux Ubuntu 12.04 or later, SteamOS 2.20 or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core I3+ or AMD equivalent recommended for HD 1080p playback<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Network Bandwidth of 12Mbps for 1080p or 8Mbps for 720p.</li></ul>"}, "developers": ["Eleventh Media"], "publishers": ["Distribber"], "price_overview": {"currency": "USD", "initial": 499, "final": 499, "discount_percent": 0, "initial_formatted": "", "final_formatted": "$4.99"}, "packages": [324026, 324025], "package_groups": [{"name": "default", "title": "Buy Eleven Days", "description": "", "selection_text": "Select a purchase option", "save_text": "", "display_type": 0, "is_recurring_subscription": "false", "subs": [{"packageid": 324026, "percent_savings_text": "", "percent_savings": 0, "option_text": "Eleven Days -

(Stop Time has a limit bar whereas speed up and slow down have unlimited use)\r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Abilities Mechanics Control:\r\nAll Green outlined obstacles in Chrono Ghost are affected by the time controlling mechanics, whereas all Red outlined obstacles are immune to the time control mechanics.\r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Natural Abilities:\r\nJump - Can be combined with the Dash ability and the Dash ability cool down. Short hop jumps and long extended jumps can be performed by tapping and long pressing the jumps button. \r\nCrouch - Crouch to avoid certain obstacles.\r\nDash - Has a cool down indicator above the character. Dashing out into an open space (off a ledge) + Jumping will allow Chrono Ghost to Dash again.\r\nCamera panning - (Controller) by pressing the B button allows the player to see what is in front to the right. \r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Platforms: \r\nGreen - Static, Moving, and Falling\r\nRed - Static Moving and, Falling\r\nBlue - These are bouncing platforms - The player receives a jump once reaching peak jumping height.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>As the Chrono Ghost, you have the responsibility of proving yourself to the Spirit of Time.
