Their skills extend past the throwing of highly explosive projectiles, also encompassing the fine art of marksmanship, muskets being the weapon of choice. Although primarily expected to fight at range, fusiliers are also more than capable in melee and on the charge.

Excellent marksmen, they excel at ranged combat but suffer in prolonged melee attacks. They are trained to conceal themselves and fight in loose formation, but if caught in the open by line infantry or cavalry they are likely to sustain heavy casualties. <br>\t\t\t\t\tSingle Player Campaign Requirements: Available when playing as Great Britain and holding the Barracks in Upper Canada </td>\t\t\t\t</tr><tr><td><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps_extras/10607/15.png\" ></td>\t\t\t\t\t<td><strong>Tarleton's Light Dragoons (Britain) \u0097</strong> Named for Banastre Tarleton, also known as &quot;The Bloody Ban&quot;, these troops are ideal for countering enemies such as skirmishers and artillery.
