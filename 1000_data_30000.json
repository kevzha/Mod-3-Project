and one mythological monsters from the frozen shores of Scandinavia! Norse myths and legends are some of the foundational stories of the fantasy RPG tradition, going back to Tolkien and beforehand. The dwarves, elves, giants, and trolls of Norse myth and legend are at the heart of our myths and monsters, but they are just the beginning of an epic legendarium of creatures. From the scions of glorious Valhalla to the miserable pits of Hel, the blazing furnace of Muspelheim to the mountain realms of the Jotuns, the Nine Worlds are a place rife with adventure and danger always ready to menace the mortals of Midgard! From CR 5 to 30, we bring you an assortment of amazing adversaries for your heroes, starting with a swarm of linnorms, the serpentine primeval dragons that lurk in the wildest reaches of the lands where civilization is but a rumor. From the magma-mouthed crag linnorm to the bitter brumal bite of the ice linnorm, from the boreal forest fastnesses where the taiga linnorm lurks to the deep, dark waters where fjord linnorms prowl, these dragons leave dread in their wake, though perhaps none more so than the corpse-tearing cairn linnorm and the terrifying two-headed tarn linnorm. Fey spirits are likewise common in Nordic tales, with fossegrim waterfall spirits beguiling with their magical music and golden glamour to shadowy svartalfar inveigling mortals with their dark beauty while the hidden huldra simply seek to blend in with mortal society in hopes of finding a mate. The spirits of Asgard itself are represented as well, from the fallen einherji warriors to the valkyries that choose the slain and the wise and mysterious norns that judge them all. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the fearsome Fenris wolf joins his brother Jormungandr the Midgard Serpent (from Mythic Monsters: Colossal) as a CR 30 menace whose hunger is endless and whose jaws span wide to devour the sun along with all life and hope. This book also contains mythic templates to bring the Nordic tropes of the Jotun thane, runecaster, and tricksome traveler to your creatures, along with additional rules for integrating mythic linnorms into your campaign!<br><br>The <i>Mythic Monsters</i> series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and \u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d will warm any GM\u2019s heart.<br><br>This all-new supplement by Jeff Lee and Jason Nelson is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!

To fully enjoy this 360\u00b0 VR Video Experience and stream it smoothly you will need a 50Mbps+ internet connection.</p><br><h1>Computer Requirements</h1><p>To play this high-resolution 6K 360\u00b0 VR Video smoothly you need a 'VR-Ready' computer with Windows 10 as a minimum requirement. If you are unsure, please get in contact with us with the specifications of your PC before purchasing.</p><br><h1>Video Quality Settings</h1><p>To change the video quality, press the up and down arrows on your keyboard to change to higher and lower resolutions or press 'A' for automatic adjustment.</p><br><h1>Current Issues</h1><p>At the moment, there seems to be a problem with the streaming network that affects some users who can only watch our videos at a maximum quality level of 3 out 4 levels. When selecting level 4, the stream stutters and sometimes comes to a complete halt, freezing the video playback. A restart of the video and selecting quality level 3 will fix this, however, selecting quality level 4 is still likely to not work. We have observed best results if we let the Steam 360 Video player automatically adjust the quality level, which you can do by pressing the 'a' key on your keyboard when the Steam 360 Video player is active. So don't try to force level 4 but instead let the application decide.<br><br>We apologise for the inconvenience and we are working with the Valve/Steam team to find the cause for this technical issue and will inform you once the problem has been identified and resolved. In the meantime, you will likely still see an improvement, even if you play back the video at quality level 3.

Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires projectiles at enemies. During the course of the game he can collect herbs and animals (called &quot;pets&quot;), which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as stronger attacks, extra speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying machine. In addition, certain segments require the player to communicate with NPCs populating the game world and fulfill their requests, usually by obtaining specific items for them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game keeps track of the player character's behavior, assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending scene depending on the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or sparing the lives of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's health is measured in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased.

We currently support both mouse-keyboard and gamepad-controller setups. The game will feature collectible upgrades for weapons and armor that are located throughout the world of Zarda. They will enhance the characters abilities and enable them to access areas in previous levels that they could not and unlock new abilities.\u200b<br><br><br>The final game will present non-linear level progression.

As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new cyberphrenic tadpole is a chillingly insidious robot of small size but great potency in corrupting the mind and will of the living who seek to resist the will of their incipient robot overlords. In addition, you can customize the robots you throw at your players with an array of robotic implants utilizing the technology rules for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, whether your heroes are arming their own robot legions or facing the forces of fearsome technomancers!<br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and \u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d will warm any GM\u2019s heart.<br><br>This supplement by <strong>Alex Riggs, Russ Taylor, and Jason Nelson</strong> is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!
