His squad discuss their deployment, somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him. \n \nOther Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies. \n \nShephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path. \n \nAt the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.", "summary": "Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game.

Howard's Conan the Cimmerian stories, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is a fantasy themed massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses players in a dark, expansive universe filled with ground-breaking brutal combat, dangerously intoxicating magical abilities, and the social and cooperative game features that MMORPG players crave.  \n  \nSet in the later years of Conan's life, after he has famously become king by his own hand, the game centers around the fragile state of Conan's rule in Aquilonia. Surrounded by enemies and hostile nations, Conan's rule hangs by a thread and in the end, it's up to players, either singly or backed by their guilds to turn the tide for or against the embattled king.  \n  \nMassively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult Player: One of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of the Conan franchise across a variety of major media, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard?s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.  \n  \nAvailable Cultures and Classes: Although Age of Conan contains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:  \n  \nAquilonians: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the \"Flower of the West.\" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.  \n  \nCimmerians: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.  \n  \nStygians: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.  \n  \nModes Singleplayer as well as Multiplayer: Unlike most MMORPGs, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures includes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game's multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture?s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game?s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game.  \n  \nIn-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.  \n  \nReal-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPS: Traditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, but Age of Conan dispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of the Hyborian universe, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It?s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.  \n  \nThe combat system in Age of Conan comes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG."}, {"id": 471, "age_ratings": [{"id": 8875, "category": 1, "rating": 6}, {"id": 8876, "category": 2, "rating": 4}], "aggregated_rating": 86.5, "game_engines": [{"id": 25, "companies": [249], "name": "CryEngine"}], "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Multiplayer"}], "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Shooter"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 241, "company": {"id": 122, "name": "Crytek Frankfurt"}, "developer": true, "publisher": false}, {"id": 242, "company": {"id": 1, "name": "Electronic Arts"}, "developer": false, "publisher": true}, {"id": 343, "company": {"id": 158, "name": "Crytek UK"}, "developer": true, "publisher": false}], "name": "Crysis 2", "platforms": [6, 9, 12], "popularity": 13.4687780689774, "release_dates": [{"id": 51983, "human": "2011-Mar-22"}, {"id": 51984, "human": "2011-Mar-22"}, {"id": 51986, "human": "2011-Mar-25"}, {"id": 51987, "human": "2011-Mar-25"}, {"id": 102305, "human": "2011-Mar-22"}, {"id": 102306, "human": "2011-Mar-25"}, {"id": 102307, "human": "2011-Apr-01"}], "storyline": "The world has been ravaged by a series of climatic disasters and society is on the verge of total breakdown.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.  \nYears later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail \"Misty\" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.  \nRegardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to \"mend the rift\" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.  \nFollowing their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as \"the Rift\" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.  \nUnbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real. It is ambiguous as to whether the events of the game mode have actually occurred or has all along been simply in Samantha's imagination.", "summary": "Black Ops II is the first game in the Call of Duty franchise to feature future warfare technology and the first to present branching storylines driven by player choice as well as selecting weapons before starting story mode missions."}, {"id": 1057, "aggregated_rating": 72.5, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}], "genres": [{"id": 15, "name": "Strategy"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Indie"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 2513, "company": {"id": 745, "name": "Futuremark Games Studio"}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "Unstoppable Gorg", "platforms": [6, 14, 36, 39], "popularity": 1.0, "release_dates": [{"id": 2579, "human": "2012-Jan-19"}, {"id": 2580, "human": "2012-Jan-19"}, {"id": 2581, "human": "2012-Jan-19"}, {"id": 2582, "human": "2012"}], "summary": "Revolutionary Tower DefenseDANGER!

In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad\u2014consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac\u2014escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'\u00e9tat, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible. \nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison. \nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them. \nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Ji\u00e9, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima. \nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal. \nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Ji\u00e9, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Ji\u00e9 had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Ji\u00e9 calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack. \nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker\u2014and the player\u2014is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".", "summary": "Battlefield 4\u2122 is the genre-defining action blockbuster created by DICE, and made from moments that blur the line between game and glory \u2013 moments found only in Battlefield.

The game begins with the narrator (played by Will Stamper) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as \"best friend to one and all\". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater. Soon afterwards, the player discovers technologically advanced, highly-evolved cats restraining a captive Hatty as he is being fitted with an ominously glowing top hat. The hat appears to change him, and he alerts the cats to the player's presence, attacking them and rendering them unconscious. \nUpon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by the cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spend on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player. \nAs the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after \"pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom.\" Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater. \nEventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player, and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again. \nAfter completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty doesn't budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator implies has sunk into a catatonic state from prolonged exposure to the hat. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song. The narrator claims to understand what just happened, but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.", "summary": "In BattleBlock Theater, players control a prisoner as they are forced to play through games devised by Hatty Hattington. Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures. \nThe main mode in the game is Adventure Mode, which can be played solo or co-operatively with a second player. During co-operative play, players are able to work together to overcome obstacles, which includes throwing them across gaps, using their heads as platforms and helping each other up ledges, although there is just as much opportunity to sabotage your partner. Adventure mode consists of various worlds each with a set of levels. In order to progress to the next world, players need to collect gems which can also be used to unlock new customiseable parts. Players can also collect balls of yarn which they can use to bribe cat guards and unlock new weapons, such as frisbees and vacuum cleaners. Collecting all gems and the yarn will get you an A++ in the level and two extra gems. Arena mode is a competitive mode for up to four players, which can be played free-for-all or in teams. There are several match types including: \nSoul: Steal enemy soul and run away. Capture and hold the enemy's souls to gain points. Kill a soul-carrier to release their souls to roam the level. \nMuckle: Beat and kill the enemy team to earn your team points. \nChallenge: Score the best time on a given level. \nKing Of The Hill: Stand on the crown blocks to gain your team points. \nColor The World: Color more blocks than the other team. \nGrab The Gold: Grab more gold from the golden whale than the other team and deposit it in the flying safe to score points for your team \nBall Game: Get the ball in the basket. \nHorse: Ride the opposing team's horse to your stables to gain points for your team. \nAlong with a Time Attack mode, the game also features a Level Editor, which allows players to create their own stages for any game type. These levels can be assembled into a playlist, consisting of various Adventure and Arena levels, and uploaded to the community for others to download. There is also additional content unlocked for players who also own Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid HD.[3][4]"}, {"id": 2153, "age_ratings": [{"id": 381, "category": 1, "rating": 3}], "aggregated_rating": 85.0666666666667, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Multiplayer"}, {"id": 3, "name": "Co-operative"}], "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Simulator"}, {"id": 14, "name": "Sport"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 7992, "company": {"id": 1, "name": "Electronic Arts"}, "developer": false, "publisher": true}, {"id": 7993, "company": {"id": 277, "name": "EA Canada"}, "developer": true, "publisher": false}], "name": "FIFA 13", "platforms": [5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 46], "popularity": 3.031678805312443, "release_dates": [{"id": 4418, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4419, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4420, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4421, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4422, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4423, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 4424, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 7015, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 7016, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 7017, "human": "2012-Nov-18"}, {"id": 7018, "human": "2012-Sep-29"}, {"id": 133666, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 133667, "human": "2012-Sep-28"}, {"id": 134970, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 134971, "human": "2012-Sep-28"}, {"id": 139399, "human": "2012-Sep-25"}, {"id": 139400, "human": "2012-Sep-28"}, {"id": 146232, "human": "2012-Nov-30"}, {"id": 146233, "human": "2012-Nov-18"}], "summary": "FIFA 13 captures the drama and unpredictability of real-world football.

The player inspects would-be immigrants' documents and uses a sparse array of tools to determine whether the papers are in order for the purpose of keeping spies, smugglers and other unwanted individuals out of the country. At the end of each in-game day, the player earns money based on how many immigrants they processed less any penalties for mistakes, and then must decide on a simple budget to spend that money on rent, food, heat, and other necessities in low-class housing for themselves and their family. As relations between Arstotzka and nearby countries deteriorate due to multiple terrorist attacks, each day introduces a new set of rules for immigration based on the game's story, such as denying citizens of specific countries or demanding more exacting identification from citizens. The player may be challenged with moral dilemmas and social engineering as the game progresses; such as allowing the supposed spouse of one immigrant through despite them lacking complete papers, even though they may be planning to attack your fellow guards. \nA mysterious anti-government organisation also appears, with several of its members appearing in the checkpoint, giving the inspector orders on what to do in order to help the organisation bring down the government and establish a new one; the player can choose whether or not to help this organisation. \nThe game has a scripted story mode with multiple possible endings depending on the player's previous actions, as well as an unlockable, randomized endless-play mode. \nPapers, Please has been praised by the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction.[12] CBC News' Jonathan Ore called Papers, Please a \"nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters - all from a desk job\"", "summary": "Papers, Please was developed by Lucas Pope beginning in November, 2012 using the Haxe programming language and the NME framework, both open-source.

An asteroid was predicted to fly right next to Earth and be a near miss. However, the asteroid instead entered the gravity well of the Moon and shattered. Many of these shards began to slam into the Earth while the bulk of the asteroid entered a low, descending orbit around the Earth, pelting it with even more debris that continued to break off of the asteroid. Eventually the asteroid itself crashed into the Earth, and with this event, plummeted mankind into a new dark age known as the Nine Year Winter. Many of the larger governments fragmented during this time, while other nations bound together, forming a strong, unified alliance.  \nHowever, during this dark age, scientists in Japan stumbled upon a new element called crystite. What they first observed was not real crystite, but seed crystite. Only later when sifting through the crash site were they able to find this new element, but only a gram or two was actually uncovered through the sifting of the earth. Many of the studies on crystite showed that it turns the known laws of physics on their head, and crystite quickly became a way to generate a massive amount of power with almost unlimited potential. Soon it became the primary power source in the world and a new golden age came to pass. However, crystite is a foreign element that came from the asteroid that impacted into the Earth, and although it is a resource potentially without limits, the world wanted more.  \nHumanity was able to plot the trajectory of the asteroid and figure out that the asteroid came from the star system of Alpha Centauri. Space-faring ships were then built and sent out on the long journey to discover the source of the original crystite. After four years of space travel, the first colonists arrive and find a world with an abundance of crystite. The first colony was created and established with the name Alpha Prime. As the first massive load of crystite arrived back on earth, seven more ships were created and began to ferry resources between the two star systems.  \nDespite this new source of energy, the world governments begin to fear that with their reliance on crystite, if there was ever a revolt on Alpha Prime, they could potentially bring Earth to its knees. Fearing this, they began to create and perfect a technology called arcfolding which effectively creates a wormhole capable of transporting matter large distances in a short time. The first tests, however, showed that whatever was moved using arcfolding technology would freeze to almost absolute zero. Eventually, an energy field was created and was able to shield organic life; the first successful test was a mouse sent from Cambridge to San Francisco with only a location deviation of 0.2 millimeters. With this technology, instead of ships taking an eight-year round trip voyage, a ship could do each leg of the journey in as little as eight days.  \nAnd so the creation of the Arclight came to pass. With the resources and collaboration of the entire world, the creation of the ship took only a few years from start to finish. A huge ship roughly the size of a small city with two massive crystite reactors to assist with safely arcfolding the crew and all those inside. It was meant to be a symbol of power over Alpha Prime and to serve as a headquarters from which Earth could secure its future. However, something went dreadfully wrong with its maiden launch.  \nThe Arclight attempted its first arcfold from a Lagrange point in its orbit for stability purposes. As the Arclight began to fold space it created what seemed to be a large tear in the fabric of the universe from which The Melding, a giant energy storm, began to pour out of the rift. The Melding itself has now settled in swaths across the Earth, leaving only small pockets of the Earth habitable.  \nThe Melding mutates and transforms all life and even the terrain of the planet. Recently, humanity has come under attack by a race calling themselves The Chosen, who have emerged from The Melding. The player takes on the role of a surviving member of the human race in the fight to push back The Chosen and to rid the Earth of The Melding.[1]  \nAt this point in time it is known that the Arclight itself crashed in Fortaleza, Brazil, but the field the Arclight generates from the seed crystite powering its still active engines has been able to keep The Melding at bay. Engineers are scared to cannibalize the Arclight because the field residue, known as a STIZ bubble, is vital to Fortaleza and doing so would surely jeopardize all those living under its protection.", "summary": "Firefall is a massively multiplayer online team-based action shooter role-playing computer game from Red 5 Studios, a studio founded by Mark Kern.

He is also introduced to a gangster known as The Mexican, whom he helps with his driving skills by delivering packages across the city and proving himself against the last driver, whom The Mexican has locked in his trunk as a punishment.

Meanwhile, T.K also helps Ray with his gambling debt by doing other odd jobs across the city to pay him off. \n \nAfter meeting up with Slink, Bishop, The Mexican and Candy, he is introduced to Corrigan, a corrupt police officer who doubles as a drug dealer. Since cocaine has a large foothold on the New York drug market and will be a rising star in the 1980s, Corrigan's organization wishes to gain leverage over cocaine distribution, but their main issue is Rafael Martinez, a Colombian drug lord who holds a monopoly on the drug trade, so they plan to have him kidnapped and held for ransom, which will be used to start a prominent drug trade. After setting up an elaborate ambush, in which Candy proves crucial with his planning skills, they successfully kidnap him. After the Colombian Cartel relents and provides ransom, T.K is collected and escapes the Cartel's men across rooftops, with The Mexican providing cover for him. After the ransom is delivered to Corrigan, he suddenly shoots Martinez dead, while the rest of the gang leaves. Corrigan reveals that T.K is set to be the fall guy, he sells T.K out and shoots him.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed \"Alias\") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth. \n \nEventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \"The Processed\". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player's squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him. \n \nAlias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad's leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth's military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov's commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory's power generators. Alias's explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass. \n \nAlias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot's statue with the nanotech cell \u2013 the culmination of Capek's research \u2013 and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov's subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov's fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias.

The kings and queens of the Holy Ashah Dynasty, however, did not always rule wisely or justly, and, as time passed, the citizenry began to resent the power of their leaders.\nFifteen years ago, this growing discontent found its ultimate expression in the person of Arris the Sage, who united the disparate anti-royal factions throughout Sostegaria and shaped them into a powerful guerrilla army. Under the cunning leadership of Arris, this Liberation Army managed to outwit and outmaneuver the Royal Army, and finally smashed through to the palace of the Ashah Dynasty itself, and burnt it to the ground.\nWith the monarchy dissolved, the rebels establish a ruling council founded on the principles of democracy and popular sovereignty. From the ashes of the Holy Ashah Empire emerges the Republic of Ishtaria. The leaders of the revolution naturally assumed leadership positions within the new republic: all, that is, except for Arris himself, who suddenly disappeared and has not been seen of, nor heard of, ever since.\nToday, the fledgling republic is in increasingly dire straits: the autocratic Minister of Defense, Hel Spites, and his elite anti-terrorism squad, the Crimson Guard, are using ever-increasing force to stamp out the last vestiges of resistance to Ishtarian rule, while they allow outlaws to roam the countryside and pirates to sail the seas. Meanwhile, Ash Lambert and his colleagues at the third battalion of the Ishtarian Security Forces begin to suspect a conspiracy at the highest levels of government. Ash's attempts to draw attention to the situation, though, only draw the ire of the conspirators themselves, leaving only Ash and his allies to foil their plans and restore order to the nation.\nAfter the credits, an extra cutscene is available that shows Eleni hearing Ash's ocarina theme while claiming \"he\" has come back.", "summary": "You assume the role of Ash Lambert, a hero torn between saving his country and restoring honor to the disgraced Lambert dynasty.

Inioch's daughter, Julia, led the wood elves and the Keepers, a group that had no genocidal intentions. These factions and others clashed in the Valley of Wonders, around the ruins of the razed elven court. The High Elf race was founded many years later when Julia married a dark elf and reunited their two races. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Empire began as a joining of races for mutual protection and the sharing of knowledge. Though it set out with benign intentions, once the Empire was through expanding, humans seized power and pushed forward with technology and commerce.\nThe Commonwealth Empire means to sweep aside the old ways and assimilate the world. The Elven Court takes exception to this, and wants to rally the ancient races to stand in defense against imperial ambitions, hence the central conflict of Age of Wonders III.", "summary": "Age of Wonders III, like the previous games in the series is a turn-based strategy game set within a high fantasy universe where the player assumes the role of a political-military leader. Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options dependant on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The \"Sorcerer\" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The \"Theocrat\" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The \"Rogue\" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The \"Archdruid\" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The \"Dreadnaught\" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the \"Warlord\" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities.\nLeaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series.\nCities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain, and they won't forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements, like a \"Giant's Keep\" for example. The player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic and/or alignment standing.

In order to keep their presence unknown they abduct 2 humans (Adam Halfpint and BoPeep) and 2 dogs (Motley and Shep) and implant them with the desire and will to herd sheep like mad men.

One day, Andy and Whiskey head for the park. A solar eclipse occurs while they're there. During the eclipse, Whiskey is taken away by an unseen creature. Andy then rushes to his treehouse, where he keeps his inventions, and jumps inside a spaceship to find Whiskey. He takes off and finds himself in the Darklands, which is a portion of the Heart of Darkness. Inhabited by creatures of the night and ruled over by an evil sorcerer that's known as the Master of Darkness, the Darklands are extremely dangerous. Andy must find it in himself in order to rescue Whiskey and find a way home. \n \nAndy collides his spaceship into a winged shadow creature and crashes in a canyon on the outskirts of the Darklands. Here, his gun is eaten by a giant monster. Andy manages to escape into the swamps, only to run into more danger while unarmed. Meanwhile, the Master of Darkness is abusing his servant when a winged shadow arrives with a sack that has Whiskey in it. Angered by the mistake (the shadow was supposed to capture Andy), the Master of Darkness kills the shadow and takes his anger out on his servant by throwing him at a spiked wall. However, the monster that swallowed Andy's gun appears, accidentally saving the servant, and explains Andy being in the Darklands. The Master of Darkness then orders his minions to search the Darklands for him. \n \nDeep in the swamp, Andy saves a winged creature that's named Amigo that starts to carry him to his home island, but is dazed by a fireball that was thrown from a winged shadow and drops Andy into a lake. At the bottom of the lake, Andy comes across a magic rock that grants him the power to manipulate plants and destroy enemies. After resurfacing, Andy is rescued once again by Amigo, who takes Andy back to his home and introduces him to his people. Andy wins their approval by creating an apple tree for them. The Amigos then agree to hide Andy in their village, but the shadows attack and destroy the village when night falls. However, Andy manages to slip away. After reuniting with the Amigos, Andy witnesses an Amigo fall to the evil ground, and becomes a winged shadow within contact. Andy convinces the Amigos to obtain the magic rock's power and wage war on the Master of Darkness. \n \nWith their newfound powers the Amigos help Andy slip into the Master of Darkness's lair. While in there, Andy is captured and thrown into a cell with Whiskey, but manages to escape and free Whiskey. Meanwhile, the Master of Darkness's minions have found the magic rock and bring it to the Master, who destroys it, thus draining Andy and the Amigos' powers. Unarmed once again, Andy can only run from the shadows. While fleeing, he accidentally falls into a hole and lands on top of the giant monster, who promptly swallows Andy whole. However, he is able to escape by obtaining his gun from the monster's stomach and blasting him in half from within. He then encounters the servant and forces him to help defeat the Master of Darkness and find Whiskey. The servant tells Andy that the only way to defeat the Master of Darkness is to drop the completed magic rock into the dark portal. Andy then searches for the fragments of the rock in order to reform it. He manages to obtain all but one piece, which is laying on the bridge near the portal. While Andy is fighting his way to the bridge, the servant betrays Andy by kicking Whiskey into the portal. \n \nAfter fighting countless shadows and dodging several fire blasts that are thrown by the Master of Darkness, Andy makes it to the bridge and obtains the final piece. The Amigos then tie up the servant and lower the rock onto the bridge, crushing the servant in the process. Ignoring the Master of Darkness's claim that everyone will be killed if he does so, Andy connects the final piece of rock, which then falls into the portal, which begins destroying the castle and the platform that the Master of Darkness floats on. He then falls into the portal, but manages to take Andy with him. \n \nThey find themselves in the main area of the Heart of Darkness, where they battle. Andy wins the fight and then hears the sound of a door opening, only to see red eyes approaching. He prepares to strike, but lights come on from Andy's mother, revealing that the eyes are Whiskey, and they are in Andy's tree house...the whole thing was in Andy's imagination. Andy's mother calls them to dinner. After being kissed goodnight by his mother, Andy taunts Whiskey's fear of the dark a bit and then turns the nightlight off, revealing that he has conquered his fear of the dark thanks to his make-believe journey. The scene then shows the Amigos finding the wreckage of Andy's ship, with the servant also there tied up, being harassed, revealing that Andy's adventure was not imaginary.", "summary": "Heart of Darkness places players in the role of a child named Andy as he attempts to rescue his dog who has been kidnapped by creatures known as The Dark Souls.

The capsule included several data canisters, each of which contains small snippets of the scientists' story, which is revealed to the player as the game progresses and data canisters are found. The capsule also contained some toxic chemicals, which have begun to leak out and threaten the health of the world's sea life. A recovery mission, codenamed Operation Neptune, is sent to recover the pieces of the capsule.\nThe game is divided into five zones: Dragon Reef, Fossil Trench, Limestone Ridge, Sea Forest, and Hammerhead. Each zone contains three \"levels\", called sectors (although the hammerhead zone also has a \"final\" sector, where there are no maths problems, but one hit from a sea creature will send the player back to the start). At the end of each sector, the submarine approaches an undersea supply station. There are two completely unique sets of levels, Voyager and Expert, each with a different story that is recovered along the way.\nThe player pilots the submarine, named the Neptune. Throughout the game, elementary school-level mathematics problems are posed, in the form of scientific situations that might concern a submarine pilot in real life. (For example, the sub's ballast may need adjusting, and this becomes an arithmetic problem.) In each sector the player will face three randomly placed math problems, as well as one problem to open that sector's data canister, and another to open the combination lock on the supply station.The box cover illustration rendered by Marc Ericksen envisions the Neptune submarine recovery vehicle hovering above the basin of Fossil Trench recovering glowing toxic data capsules.", "summary": "Operation Neptune is an educational computer game produced in 1991 by The Learning Company.

Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we\u2019re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it\u2019s also about the end of the world. \n\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There\u2019s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That\u2019s an interesting place to start telling a story.\n\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it\u2019s a character in its own right. It\u2019s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\n\nThe game is all about discovery. It\u2019s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It\u2019s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story \u2013 the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture\u2019s world."}, {"id": 7663, "age_ratings": [{"id": 4532, "category": 1, "rating": 3}], "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}], "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Platform"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 27991, "company": {"id": 764, "name": "Psygnosis"}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "The Adventures of Lomax", "platforms": [6, 7], "popularity": 1.0, "release_dates": [{"id": 20053, "human": "1996-Oct-31"}, {"id": 20054, "human": "1996-Nov-01"}, {"id": 20055, "human": "1997-Dec-18"}, {"id": 40403, "human": "1997"}], "summary": "Lomax is in way over his head.

On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy\u2014the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2] \n \nThe series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that \"The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around.\"[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro. \n \nContents [hide] \n1\tGames \n1.1\tOriginal \n1.1.1\tPGA Tour Golf (1990) \n1.1.2\tPGA Tour Golf II (1992) \n1.1.3\tPGA Tour Golf III (1994) \n1.1.4\tPGA Tour 96 (1995) \n1.1.5\tPGA Tour 97 (1996) \n1.1.6\tPGA Tour 98 (1997) \n1.2\tTiger Woods \n1.2.1\tTiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf (1998) \n1.2.2\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 (1999) \n1.2.3\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 (2000) \n1.2.4\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 (2002) \n1.2.5\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002) \n1.2.6\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 (2003) \n1.2.7\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 (2004) \n1.2.8\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 06 (2005) \n1.2.9\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 07 (2006) \n1.2.10\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 08 (2007) \n1.2.11\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 09 (2008) \n1.2.12\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 10 (2009) \n1.2.13\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 11 (2010) \n1.2.14\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 12 (2011) \n1.2.15\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 13 (2012) \n1.2.16\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 14 (2013) \n1.3\tRory McIlroy \n1.3.1\tRory McIlroy PGA Tour (2015) \n1.4\tRelated \n1.4.1\tPGA European Tour (1994) \n1.4.2\tPGA Tour Pro (1997) \n1.4.3\tTiger Woods PGA Tour (2009) \n1.4.4\tTiger Woods PGA Tour Online (2010) \n2\tReferences \n3\tExternal links \n \n \n \nTiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002)[edit] \nMain article: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 \nReleased in 2002 for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube."}, {"id": 8392, "age_ratings": [{"id": 9590, "category": 1, "rating": 3}, {"id": 9591, "category": 2, "rating": 1}], "aggregated_rating": 86.0, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}], "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Platform"}, {"id": 9, "name": "Puzzle"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Indie"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 34354, "company": {"id": 1108, "name": "Two Tribes B.V."}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}, {"id": 34355, "company": {"id": 9493, "name": "Mobigame"}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "EDGE", "platforms": [3, 6, 9, 14, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 92], "popularity": 1.0, "release_dates": [{"id": 29052, "human": "2011-Aug-11"}, {"id": 49226, "human": "2011-Aug-11"}, {"id": 49227, "human": "2013-Jul-19"}, {"id": 49228, "human": "2013-Jul-19"}, {"id": 49229, "human": "2008-Dec"}, {"id": 49230, "human": "2010-Feb-09"}, {"id": 49231, "human": "2010-Dec-02"}, {"id": 49232, "human": "2011-Sep-20"}, {"id": 49233, "human": "2010-Dec-02"}, {"id": 49234, "human": "2013-Nov-21"}, {"id": 49235, "human": "2013-Dec-26"}, {"id": 67288, "human": "2011-Aug-11"}, {"id": 139089, "human": "2013-Dec-26"}, {"id": 139090, "human": "2014-Jan-02"}, {"id": 146221, "human": "2013-Nov-21"}], "summary": "In EDGE players take direct control of the cube and roll their way around the game's dozens of levels.

It was published by Interplay.\n\nThe objective of the game is to progress through four time periods, building and controlling tanks from that period to fight the \"evil black tanks\" from a more advanced period. Notably, tanks are constructed by hand out of parts, which are randomly constructed by a factory (the \"Part-o-Matic\") in the player's base when it is provided with resources. Different parts may offer the ability to cross different terrain, offensive capabilities more suitable to current tactics, and so forth. The player's primary control is \"the crane\", a flying magnet (held by, for example, a pterodactyl in the first, ancient time period) which can pick up and drop single parts. A suitable pile of parts becomes a tank, which can be selected and ordered to move by the magnet.\n\nThe game also has a strong puzzle bias. The magnet can also pick up boulders (e.g. for blocking off enemy routes) and sheep (which can be used to increase the factory's production rate, amongst other things), and there are various terrain types with lasting effects. For example, driving a tank through mud will make it dirty, causing them to move more slowly until you wash them. Some maps have buttons on them which can only be activated by tanks with sufficient combat experience, and it can take considerable foresight to ensure that a tank will be able to survive to that level and be able to reach the button. Dissassembling a tank will make it lose all experience.\n\nThe game is very micromanagement heavy, requiring the player to spread one's attention thinly over maintaining the continually tiring sheep at the factory, tank battles, negotiation of terrain hazards such as quicksand, and tank construction. The metaphor of the 'cursor' being a flying magnet with a physical presence in the world can make moving the viewpoint between all these tasks troublesome.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n-Basics\nThere are four worlds in campaign mode: Stone Age, Medieval, Modern, and Futuristic, each containing six levels. The enemy will always be one world in technology above you, the final one being the \"Evil Black Tanks\" themselves. There are also a challenge and training mode, the challenge consisting of levels in which you need to do a certain task (From killing certain tanks with boulders to crushing black sheep to defending your base with tanks needing to be reassembled) in a fixed time limit.\n\nThe Part-O-Matic is the only structure in the game controlled by you. It produces a set of parts, determined by the level, one by one. The speed is determined by the number of sheep on its wheel. Sheep are found randomly grazing and can be picked up by your crane and dropped on your Part-O-Matic's wheel. After an allotted amount of time, sheep will grow tired and need to be restored in the sheep dip found throughout the level, there is commonly one beside your main HQ. Once they have rested, they may be put back on the wheel. Black sheep are your sheep's enemy, as they will spread their disease to other sheep, rendering them useless. Once a sheep has been infected, you may put it in the green goo where it heals. However, once it turns completely black, there is no way to restore it to its previous state. In order to stop the sheep from getting infected at all is to kill the black sheep via boulder to the head. Sheep are fragile, and can be killed by your enemies or by accident. Sacrificing parts to your Part-O-Matic, such as enemy tank pieces, sheep, boulders, or crates, allows the Part-O-Matic to constantly reproduce from the pre-determined queue randomly set up in-game. Crates, as the main resource for you, are found all over the place and can be carried by your tanks and returned to your Part-O-Matic. One tank can hold 4 crates and sometimes crates can be difficult to get a hold of, so the default template is a lot of powerful weapons on a 4-exhaust engine placed on water-tracks.\n\nThere are four main parts to make tanks in the game. The track determines what areas of terrain the tank can cross. These included wheels, tracks which can only cross basic terrain, such as stone, half-tracks, tracks which can cross desert, snow-mobiles, tracks which can cross over snow, boats, which can cross over water, and hover-crafts, tracks which can cross over anything without suffering the effects of the ground. Making tanks without tracks renders them immobile, similar to turrets. The engine determined not only how fast the tank can go, but how many weapons an individual tank can possess. Weapons weighed down a tank and made it slower, in effect a tank with a total of five engine power and three weapons would travel the same speed as a tank with a total engine power of two and no weapons. The weapons automatically shoots at enemies within its range. You can place as many weapons in a tank as it had engine power, and can not exceed a fixed height limit. You can also order tanks to attack a specific tank or area of terrain. There are over sixty weapons in-game throughout the five time periods. Finally, the radar only comes in one variety, and is needed to make the tank function.\n\nIn the game, there are power-ups, collected both by being made by the Part-O-Matic and unlocked by buttons requiring a certain experience level of the tank that touches it. These buttons may also unlock certain areas or parts necessary to winning the game. Furthermore, there are boulders, movable by crane, which can be )1 Used as Part-O-Matic resource, )2 Used to attack enemies, )3 Used as walls from enemy tanks, or )4 Used to crush black sheep.\n\nTerrain\nThere are four main types of terrain: Ground, which can be crossed by any track and can be composed of stone, grass, dirt, etc., and Snow, Desert, and Water, only crossable by their counterpart tracks. In addition, there are quicksand, which sinks tanks' tracks and any dropped objects, mud puddles, which cause tank tracks to get muddy and slow down until cleaned, lava, which burns anything that touches it until put out by water or waiting, acid, which hurts anything that touches it until taken off, and green-goo, which rests sheep and cleans off parts.\n\nCombat\nIn combat, each part has its own health. If the health reaches zero, the part will fly off the tank, destroyed. If the tracks are destroyed, all but one engine will fall off and the tank will become immobile. If an engine is destroyed, and the remaining engines can't support the number of weapons being used, weapons will fall off until the number of weapons matches the total engine power. If the radar is destroyed or the final engine is lost, the tank will cease to function, and lose all of its experience. The tank, unless ordered otherwise, will attack the closest enemy in range of its farthest weapon. If the tank is ordered to attack a specific enemy that is out of range of some weapons, the others will attack the closest enemy within range. Enemies will obey the same rules, except when attacking the Part-O-Matic. The destination of all enemies spawned after the start of the game is your Part-O-Matic. When attacking the Part-O-Matic, enemies will ignore their surroundings. Enemies spawn at receiver points and move to your Part-O-Matic.\n\nObjectives\nYour main objective in campaign mode is to eliminate all enemy spawn points by first unlocking them by pressing buttons with certain level requirements, and then attacking the now exposed vulnerable center. Once all spawn points have been destroyed, all remaining tanks including those guarding points of interest will move in to attack. Once all enemy tanks have been destroyed, you will win and complete the level. If your Part-O-Matic is destroyed, you have lost. However, in the last level of each of the four worlds, your objective is to capture a transmitter from the enemy \"Evil Black Tanks\" that guard them, and return it to your base. In these levels, there are no enemy spawn points to destroy."}, {"id": 11834, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Multiplayer"}], "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Fighting"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 25722, "company": {"id": 2428, "name": "5pb."}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "Infinite Stratos: Versus Colors", "platforms": [6], "popularity": 4.173870781194246, "release_dates": [{"id": 33078, "human": "2014-Dec-31"}], "summary": "Infinite Stratos: Versus Colors is a high-speed 3D battle action based on the Infinite Stratos light novel franchise where players fight in flight-powered mecha suits.

This shock wave causes any tank that it hits to spin off.\nTurbo - Gives 8 seconds of Turbo Acceleration.\nMines - Drops 3 mines behind your tank, which when driven over cause you to lose control.\nShield - Gives you a shield for 10 seconds. If you are shot whilst you have the shield the weapon will have no effect on you.\nAlien Abduction - When a tank is hit with this it will be abducted by a UFO and transported back down the track.\nElectro Mine - Causes you to lose control of the tanks turret for 6 seconds.\nSlider Rizer - This is a mine based weapon that causes the tank to slide around as if out of control.\n\n\nMOBILE PHONE VERSION:\nA mobile phone version (known as Tank Racer Mobile, Tank Racer Portable and Portable Tank Racer) of the game was released by GlobalFun and Runestone Games on February 28 2005.

April 17, 2035 saw the creation of the World Council. The Council saw humanity's survival in interplanetary supply of resources mined on other celestial bodies. They sent out a large group of probes to nearly every planet and moon of the Solar System. After a lengthly search, they had found that the richest object is Titan. The Council started the Outlive Project: constructing three starships which would carry the initial colonists there. However, there was a problem: Titan's atmosphere was toxic to humans, and the climate was not so friendly either.\n\nTwo groups had arisen to solve the problem. One of them, led by Dr. Joseph Taylor, had tried to create genetically modified creatures to do the initial work. The other group, led by Dr. Mary-Anne Harley and sponsored by Mechatronics Inc., would combine robotics with sophisticated AI, making them suitable to do anything without the need for human supervision. Due to the shortage of time, the World Council gave both teams one Earth year to create working prototypes of the respective projects.\n\nAs the Outlive project neared completion, Dr. Taylor was ordered to relocate to a new research base after an unsuccessful attempt on his life. Prior to the transfer, all staff and equipment was stored in a military outpost. As LA forces held the sector, the newly created Special Counter-Terrorist Group and its leader, Brad Maxwell, had to clear a safe way for the convoy to the lab. Maxwell was a little angry at Taylor, as the impatient scientist had gone to the lab already when he reached the outpost. However, shortly after their arrival, a breakout of the unstable beings known as Abominables occurred. They had destroyed the base, scattering the staff. Taylor had been found and evacuated. Because of the accident, the World Council had terminated Taylor's contract, much to his protest, declaring that the three Outlive ships will have a robotic crew. However, the Liberty Army had occupied Mechatronics.\n\nMaxwell had cleared them out, using some of the Mechatronics' head, Carl Eberhardt's prototype battle robots. Even though the LA has been pushed out, Maxwell became suspicious of Mechatronics' motives, as materials used for weapons had been found in the facility. One of his subordinates, Lieutenant Peter Mackenzie, accompanied him to the Experimental City, where they believed Mechatronics trained their robots as soldiers. Although General Kaminski told them to don't care with this subject, they found hard proof in the Technology Center. Kaminski promised them a complete investigation after the Outlive mission was away.\n\nThe three ships were finally completed, but the launch was halted by news of two AA-artilleries recently installed by Pablo Morales, leader of the Liberty Army, very close to the launching sites. As both of them had been destroyed by Maxwell, the mission was finally launched. However, there were a third artillery, hidden in an underground base. SCTG forces quickly destroyed it, but the damage has been done: the rocket hit Outlive-1. Upon reentry, the ship broke into 3 larger pieces. Outlive-2 had reported of a contact with something then connection was lost. Outlive-3 reported they had safely landed on Titan and started mining operations as per orders.\n\nThe World Council received reports that Liberty Army forces were on their way to the crash site. As Maxwell and Mackenzie arrived in the sector, Kaminski told them that he was allied with Mechatronics, and ordered all of their units to execute them. But he had been interrupted by Mackenzie who told Maxwell that he is an operative to the Liberty Army; Morales had known of the World Council's corruption and their affiliation with Mechatronics; that was the reason why he attacked the corporation's facility and tried to prevent the launch. Infuriated, Maxwell willingly joined the Army to make Kaminski pay for his betrayal. Both were rescued by Morales, who told them that the robots from the downed ship had started to establish a base and mine, as if they were really on Titan. To prevent the Council from utilizing them, the three destroyed the camp and their commander, Procyon.\n\nUtilizing information acquired by an agent, they have discovered that the Council had built ICBMs, missiles packed with nuclear warheads of a large yield. They plan to use it against the Liberty Army's encampments around the world. Mackenzie successfully disarmed all silos, however the last were booby-trapped: when Mackenzie went inside to work on that, the multi-megaton warhead exploded. After a long-lasting and bloody battle, the Liberty Army bested both the most elite forces of the World Council and the well-armed support troops of the Mechatronics. The Council had collapsed, and the Army had formed the Confederation.\n\nRobot Campaign: When the Outlive-2 got out of contact, they had been secretly recalled to Earth to help the World Council against the Liberty Army. However, the war was already over when they had landed. Commander of the ship, Argus, had set \"his\" first objective of contacting Eberhardt. When \"he\" reached the base, it was in bad condition because of a surprise attack. Eberhardt fled, but was found. After destroying the nearby Confederate outpost, Eberhardt revealed his plans to Argus: \"he\" would have to construct and protect a portal to Titan, from which additional help in the form of Draco, leader of Outlive-3 and his minions will emerge. With this newfound help, they had recaptured Mechatronics.\n\nSome time after this, Eberhardt has been contacted by Kaminski. The Russian offered info for a meeting. As Eberhardt didn't trust him, Argus was sent. His instincts were right, as it was a trap. Kaminski said that Maxwell had granted him protection if he manages to capture a commander. Draco was enraged, and leveled the base, but Argus was already shipped to another. \"He\" was rescued this time, with Kaminski personally killed by Draco.\n\nDraco received intelligence of a secret base in a valley, where Dr. Harley is experimenting with robots. When the base was destroyed, the two commanders went through the valley in search for more enemies. They had been surprised by a large amount of troops and Dr. Harley, who congratulated Argus for a good job. It turns out that she altered Argus' programming so that he would obey and sell Draco out. The latter obviously did not want to go through this and had gone berserk. However, the troops gained the upper hand and left him for dead. \"He\" was rescued by Eberhardt.\n\nThe two had learned about Harley's experiments and that she needed a cache of microprocessors to power up her own robots. They had prevented the cargo from reaching the destination, and even destroyed the Confederate forces in a large-scale attack.\n\nCooperation campaign: Mechatronics had taken control of the planet and the last remnants of the Confederacy is being hunted by robotic execution squads. Maxwell has been captured, Morales and Argus are on the run. The remaining forces of the Liberty Army and the Robots loyal to the Confederacy had formed the Resistance. Argus and Pablo had formed a base of both humans and Robots which had been attacked by two different Robotic bases, from both the North (Blue base) & from the South (Cyan base). Then the Campaign has a twist, if you destroy the Blue base, Argus and Pablo go to rescue Maxwell which is protected by a Robotic Stronghold and a strong Robotic army which was led by a Robotic Commander named Sentinel. But if you destroy the Cyan base, Argus & Pablo alone go to save Dr. Marry Anne Harley which was attacked by Robots. When Argus & Pablo go to save Maxwell, they first have to destroy Sentinel for he was the only Al in the army & if he was destroyed, the Robotic Army would shut down. When Sentinel was destroyed, Argus & Pablo had destroyed the Robotic Stronghold & rescued Maxwell. The Resistance had also taken the remaining Robots and reprogrammed them to serve the Resistance. When Argus & Pablo alone went to rescue Dr. Mary Anne Harley, they had to destroy the AA-Artillery, which wasn't easy for they had to sneak pass the Robots which were well armed and had set up a large base. When Argus & Pablo destroyed the AA-Artillery, the Resistance Air-Force could come and destroy the Robots, thus rescuing Dr. Mary Anne. After these 2 missions, Argus and Pablo gather the Men and Robots of the Resistance and destroy the Mechatronics base in a large scale battle. The Resistance won, thus bringing the end to the harsh rule of Mechatronics. Carl had escaped, but the New Confederation had been formed, with Brad Maxwell as its leader, and an era of peace had begun. Little did they know, that Carl had escaped from Earth and hidden himself in a space station, somewhere not far from Earth. It was at that moment that it was discovered that Carl Eberheart was working for an alien race that wishes to bring Earth to ruin. Carl was executed by the Alien Leader for his failure.

In addition, players are able to create their own custom characters, though the story mode will still progress as if you were playing as Kirito. Parties of up to three characters may be formed, up from two in the prior games. In keeping with being set in Alfheim Online, players are able to fly as well as walk on the ground. However, walking within dungeons is mandatory. Auto-attacks are disabled while in flight mode, but players may instead target individual parts of an enemy's body as they see fit. In addition, this game adds the ability to use magic to attack enemies or to provide support to one's party. The game is the first in the series to allow for four-person online multiplayer."}, {"id": 12274, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}], "genres": [{"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 26097, "company": {"id": 6407, "name": "Yurin Yurin"}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o: Tenshi-tachi no Yakusoku", "platforms": [6], "popularity": 1.0, "release_dates": [{"id": 35032, "human": "2014-Mar-28"}], "summary": "Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o: Tenshi-tachi no Yakusoku is an adult visual novel and the sixteenth game in the Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o series of games.

Flyff is a fairly typical party-oriented grinding game where no character can do everything; efficient play requires working in groups to level up by killing monsters, or Masquerpets. Its main distinctiveness lies in its flying system: flying is the normal method of transportation for characters above level 20.\n\nFlyff is hosted in 13 countries and 10 languages and is played by over 30 million people.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nPlayers control an avatar that spends most of its active time fighting and most of its inactive time running a shop. Character classes are chosen at level 15 and sub-classes at levels 60 and 130, referred to as the first, second, and third job changes. The job changes are obligatory\u2014when a character reaches the requisite level, experience gain stops until the completion of one of the job quests. At level 120, the character can become a Master, returning to level 60 with enhanced powers and able to work its way back up to level 121 and become a Hero. As of version 17, Heroes may select a third job class at level 130 and level up to the current cap of 150.\n\nLevels are gained based on experience, which can be acquired by killing Masquerpets and by performing quests. Quests generally involve killing specific Masquerpets and collecting the different quest objects they drop; a typical early quest is that of \"Party of Is,\" with the requirement of collecting 7 Chupims through killing Pukepukes.\n\nAt each level, the character receives skill points that can be invested in skills available to its job(s). There are two types of skills: those used for attacking and those used for protection and/or enhancement. Skills may have cool-down times and may cause status effects, with confusion, stun, and bleed among the most common effect. It is not possible to acquire maximum levels in all available skills until becoming a level 60 Master.\n\nCharacters can be improved by acquiring objects such as improved equipment. Masquerpets drop equipment, the in-game currency penya, consumable items such as food and potions, and quest objects, or players can purchase equipment from other players note this is usually extremely expensive because of the high quality gear that can be acquired this way. These can all be traded between players; Flyff gameplay involves large amounts of buying and selling in order to collect desired equipment. Most equipment items have minimum levels at which they can be used.\n\nCombat\nFlyff features melee, ranged and magic combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic power bars are able to be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic.\n\nPvP\nPlayer versus player (PvP) combat is allowed on all servers without penalty in the form of dueling. Both players must be over level 15, and within 30 levels of each other, then they must confirm the duel first unless they are within the PvP Arena, a free-for-all environment found on all servers. Player killing is allowed only on the Yetti server and carries a high penalty.\n\n\nSOCIAL SYSTEMS:\nLord System\nIntroduced in version 12, the Lord system allows eligible players to be voted as the Lord of their server for 2 weeks. Players must have obtained Hero or Master status to qualify as a Lord candidate. While a Lord, a player may introduce a number of events on the server. Lords are taxed between 0 to 20% on all NPC purchases and returns and are given a portion of all player taxes. 10% of eligible voters must participate in the Lord vote for a Lord to be chosen. To vote for a candidate, a player must be at least level 60 and must have logged in to the game within the last 30 days. Each player may only vote for one candidate per election.\n\nParty System\nPlayers who join a party gain increased experience and loot. A lone player does not benefit from or harm a party. A party starts as a Regular Party, in which experience is distributed evenly among party members in the same location. At level 10, the party becomes Advanced, at which point experience can be distributed to players based on their amount of damage done. An Advanced Party may have up to 8 players; having this many players in a party increases player experience with each monster killed during training.\n\nGuild System\nGuilds allow players to socialize; players within a guild can chat with each other and many in-game activities are guild-based. Guilds have a hierarchical chain of command, consisting of the Master/Leader, Kingpins, Captains, Supporters, and Rookies. The guild master may change the permissions for guild members, allowing members to withdraw items or money from the guild bank, rank-up or de-rank other members, and be paid daily. Guilds are able to choose an emblem and cloak to represent themselves and have the use of a warehouse. When a guild reaches the appropriate guild level, increased by supporting the guild through quest items and Penya, the guild master may create guild cloaks at a cost that sport the guild's symbol. A large amount of Flyff end-game content is guild-related.\n\nGuild Siege\nThis event, held on Saturday in channel 1 of each server, allows guilds to compete in a free-for-all environment. A total of 8 Guilds may enter, and each Guild may have 10 players. To compete, the Guild leader must place a bid; the 8 highest bidders compete.\n\nClockworks War\nThe Clockworks War is a guild dungeon that guilds of any level may enter a single time. If the guild fails against the dungeon boss, its players may reattempt to win as many times as necessary for a time period of one hour. Only one guild is permitted inside the Clockworks Arena at a time.\n\nCouple System\nThe couple system, implemented in Version 13, allows a marriage-style connection between two characters. Characters who become a couple are granted special buffs and skills and receive gifts with new couple level gained.\n\nMentor/Pupil System\nThe Mentor/Pupil system, implemented in Version 15, allows any player level 91 or above to take on any character who has not completed their second Job Change as a pupil after completing the mentor qualification quest. This Mentor/Pupil bond provides a special bonus to experience gained by both mentor and pupil while both characters are logged on to the same server. Additionally, upon the pupil reaching certain level marks, the mentor gains 'Mentor Points'; as the mentor gains more of these points, additional pupils may be taken on, to a maximum of 3 pupils when over 100 Mentor Points are gained. These additional pupils grant increases to the experience bonus of the mentor; the other pupils' experience bonus' remain unchanged.\n\nWhile no action apart from the initial bonding is necessary within the Mentor/Pupil relationship, mentors are encouraged to help their pupils with advice, quests, and/or occasional gifts. If at any time either pupil or mentor becomes dissatisfied, the player may cancel the bond. The Mentor Points of a mentor who loses all pupils returns to 0 and must be regained through new Mentor/Pupil bonds.\n\n\nOTHER GAME SYSTEMS:\nEvents\nEvents involving rare drops and extra experience are held almost every week by the gamemaster team. Maintenance is held every Tuesday evening (gPotato) and Thursday noon (FlyFF PH).\n\nCollector System\nRe-Introduced in version 11, the Collector System allows players to collect rare and unique game items through the use of a Collectors.\n\nPrivate Shops\nPlayers can open private shops, in which held items can be sold at any price. Other players can enter these shops and purchase the items within, with the purchase money transferred to the shop owner's inventory.\n\nRaising Pets\nPlayers may keep seven types of Raised Pets, which start out as eggs that may be dropped by any Masquerpet level 20 and above. An egg can be hatched by the Pet Tamer NPC after feeding the egg 50,000 pet feed. To evolve a pet, players must complete quests given by the Pet Tamer. Pets must also be fed to keep them alive. Each Raised Pet has five levels and three appearances. A player accompanied by a pet receives additional stat points based on the type of pet.\n\nElements\nMonsters are generally associated with a particular in-game elements, of which there are five. Each element is vulnerable to one element and resistant to another. Weapons and armor can be \"elemented\", conferring advantages against monsters of some types and disadvantages against others; many aggressive spells are also elemented.\n\nCash Shop\nFlyff uses a micropayment system through which users can obtain 'Game Cash'. Game Cash can be exchanged for premium items not otherwise available in the game, including clothing, potions, different kinds of scrolls and pick-up pets.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nIn December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea. In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was commercially launched in December.\n\n\nTECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT:\nGame mechanics\nAeonsoft employs its own in-house core technology. The world object engine uses load balancing middle-ware, multi-thread and parallel game logic processing. The 3D flying engine uses faster process with vector and collide mesh and 3D space divided by Octree System. Its network sync engine utilities packet optimization by object move estimation, client-side sync calculation, and object move calibration processes."}, {"id": 12272, "game_modes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Single player"}], "genres": [{"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}], "involved_companies": [{"id": 26095, "company": {"id": 6407, "name": "Yurin Yurin"}, "developer": true, "publisher": true}], "name": "Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o: Tenshi-tachi no Harukoi", "platforms": [6], "popularity": 1.0, "release_dates": [{"id": 35030, "human": "2013-Aug-30"}], "storyline": "Yuuno had just been admitted to nursing school and was filled with a desire to watch over her classmate and roommate, Satsuki.\n\nSatsuki was a brilliant girl who was admitted to nursing school with top marks; however, she wasn\u2019t very aware of her surroundings, and her ability to get by on her own was extremely poor\u2026 She was kind of eccentric.\n\nFrom that time on, Yuuno spent her days feeling fulfilled in the role of an accomplished older girl taking care of an inept younger sister\u2026\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve become more than friends.

The mortal leader of the barbarian Followers of Vorr, King Targor, models his rule after Tarnum the Barbarian Tyrant, so Tarnum sends Grumba, an ogre who is his second-in-command, to search for the Pendant of Total Recall. This will allow Targor to see the experiences Tarnum has been forced to undergo over all the centuries following his tyrannical rule, and will hopefully end Targor's madness. \n \nAn elven druid named Nilidon who comes to aid Tarnum tells him that the tunnel system Tarnum has been in is in fact the World Tree, also known as the Roots of Life. Tarnum finds the Pendant of Total Recall, letting Targor see the error in his ways. Targor turns his army against Vorr and dies fighting him.

This scene is spliced with flashbacks to a trial, where Brian is accused of apparently killing General Kordsmier, but due to a case of amnesia, he is deemed insane and locked away in a mental institution. \n \nChapter 1: Brian Basco is Dead \nAfter the funeral has ended, Gina receives a call from Brian, who tells her to save him, because he's trapped in his own grave. He ends the call because his battery is very low. Just before the battery dies, he sends a message to Gina. \n \nChapter 2: The Art of Running Away \nGabbo, a friend of Brian's from the asylum, tells Gina the story about how Brian escapes. Gabbo tells Brian a plan, but Kurgan steals the plan and runs off to use it himself. With a bit of improvisation, Brian overcomes these obstacles but stops part-way through the escape as he finds Kurgan decapitated. \n \nChapter 3: A Timely Suicide \nIn a cabin out in the woods, Gina helps a psychologist investigate the death of a witness that would have exonerated Brian. His death had been ruled a suicide. \n \nChapter 4: An Unexpected Ally \nThe story of Brian's escape resumes, as we learn how he plans on using Kurgan's body to look like his own. \n \nChapter 5: Deconstructing Brian \nWe finally learn some of what happened between the ending of Runaway 2 and the opening of this game.

The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors. \n \nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an \u201cAdvance Time\u201d to speed up the flow of time.
